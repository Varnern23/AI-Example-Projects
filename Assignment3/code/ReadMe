Hey Sorry for the delay honestly didnt think you would accept as late as you offered so I made the finishing touches here and double checked everything and A4 is almost done as well. But the way my code works is you compile it then run a typical command running line like for example ./a.out then a space then the desired algorithm between hill, walksat, and dpll and then the cnf file all with a space between them and the prior mention.
